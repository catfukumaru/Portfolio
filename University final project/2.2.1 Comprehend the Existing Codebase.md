## 1. Review Documentation
Start with any available documentation to understand the system's architecture and design decisions.

- no available documentation
    
## 2. Execute the Application
Run the software to observe its behavior and identify areas needing attention.
- could not run the code because the .venv I set up previously did not work.
	- [x] download the libraries
### folder explanations
#### 1. access lzma compression
- purpose: it seems that it is just reading a file
- it returns nothing. 
- it has no test file 
#### 2. blowfish decryption

^a96fd6

##### file
- purpose: takes the ``` cipher_text, key, initialization_vector``` from is corresponding encryption file
- explanation:
	- a cipher is made from the key and the vector
	- cipher_text is decrypted and theun paaded
	- then it is reutned
- it returns b'deepak' but there is nothing in the file signifying that it is correct
##### test file
- the output of the file is used to evaluate the test
- it doesn't work
- error:
	- ```assert b'like a dragon' == Decr_blowfish_v1.Decr_blowfish(test)
E       AttributeError: module 'Decr_blowfish_v1' has no attribute 'Decr_blowfish'```


#### 3.blowfish encryption
##### file
- purpose: implements an encryption file
- explanation: 
	- pads the text.
	- makes a```cipher_text, key, initialization_vector and encryptor```
	- then it returns a tuple with ```cipher_text, key and initialization_vector```
	- 
- it returns ```(b'\x18\xf9\xa0\x87\x86F_\xb3', b'\x14\x82\x03\x98\t_\xbd\xdc\x85h\xbf\x02\xfft\xd7\xd3\xa8y \xdf\xf8\xe8\x16\xaf\xa6Y\xb0\x15\x1dd#\x1f', b'H\xcaj\xe6\x10y\xf7\xfe')```
- the test data is ``` b"deepak"```
	- i.e the [[[2.2.1 Comprehend the Existing Codebase#^a96fd6|decryption file works]]
##### test file
- the output of the file is used to evaluate the test
- it doesn't work
	- error = ```b'x\xdf9\xc2\xfd\xfbp7j\xb8\x973\x04\xf9WG' != (b'\x07\xc3\x02\xa7OT0\xd2\xf7\xdb\xce\xc9\x15cSC',b'\x1cx9\xbe\xca\xd5O\\\x8c1Sj\xb7\xa5\x9dGYg#\xe5*\xf1\xa4\xd6'
 b'\x8b\x99\xa6\xa0q\xc1\xf7C',
 b'\x94\xdd\x12(\xaa\x17"\xf0')```


#### 4. camelia encryption
##### file
- purpose: implements an encryption file
- explanation: 
	- pads the text.
	- makes a```cipher_text, key, initialization_vector and encryptor```
	- then it returns a tuple with ```cipher_text, key and initialization_vector```
	- 
- it returns ```(b'\x80)\xe2]\x98\xdc;\xf0%\xbf\xae\x07\xd9r\xcdo', b' g\x9az\x9c\x81\xb0\x1a\t\xd2i\xfc\xbaH\x81/\x15g\xae\x02$\x14LN\xaf\xeaZ\xd6[\x8b+\xc1', b'\xdf#\x91\x98\xfc\xec\x80K\x96e[\xdf\xb3\xb92\xdc')```
- the test data is ```b"like a dragon"```

##### test file
- the output of the file is used to evaluate the test
- it doesn't work
	- this is the error
		- ```b'x\xdf9\xc2\xfd\xfbp7j\xb8\x973\x04\xf9WG' != <module 'camellia_v1' from 'D:\\Documents 08.06.24\\2024\\final project 2.0 pdf encryptor\\part 6 implementation\\version 2\\camelia encryption\\camellia_v1.py'>```


#### 5. camellia decryption
##### file
- purpose: takes the ``` cipher_text, key, initialization_vector``` from is corresponding encryption file
- explanation:
	- a cipher is made from the key and the vector
	- cipher_text is decrypted and theun paaded
	- then it is reutned
- it returns ```b'like a dragon'```  its test data is ```
b"}\xa1\xd6-\x19>>\x82\xa7\xdc>'o\xfcs\xf0", b'\xd0%\x03\x1e\\\xd8\xdd2\x03\x82\xfcH!)+\xab\xc6\xf6\xc4\xaa\x10\xcbr\x99\xc5\xcc\x14Li\xd4\xd5*', b'\xe8J\xf7\xcdC\x8e6\xcd\xe2:r\xbd\xe2K}\xc4'```
##### test file
- the output of the file is used to evaluate the test
- it doesn't work
- error:
	- ```assert b'like a dragon' == Decr_blowfish_v1.Decr_blowfish(test)
E       AttributeError: module 'Decr_blowfish_v1' has no attribute 'Decr_blowfish'```



#### 6. help command
##### help_v1
- purpose: n/a
- explanation:
		- it seems to be an empty template of  guiding the programmer what to put in each function
- it returns as error
	- ```  super().__init__(param_decls, required=required, **attrs) 
TypeError: Parameter.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'help'```
##### help_v2
- purpose: n/a
- explanation: prints ```Hello guest``` on the terminal
- it returns prints ```Hello guest``` on the terminal


#### 7. lzma compression
##### lzma_v1
- purpose: compresses a file
- explanation: 
	- compress the data from the parameter
	- opens a file
	- write the compressed versoin of the data into the file. 
- it returns ```None```

#### 8. lzma decompression
##### access_lzma_v1
- purpose: decompresses a file
- explanation: 
	- opens a file
	- saves the data in the file in a variable
- it returns the decompressed version of the data
- error: ```self._fp = builtins.open(filename, mode) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'file.xz'```
