## User requirements
1. there are 2 players
	1. both of them must be human
2. there are 2 boxes
	1. 1 has a carrot
3. each player gets given a box
4. the first player is the only one allowed to check their box to see if they have a carrot
5. the first player can lie or say the truth to the second
6. the second player can choose whether they can swap boxes
7. program says who won

## Functional requirements
 1. there is a player function
	 1. the function can choose a box 
	 2. it can check if it is the first player or not
	 3. it return a  Carrot true or False for each player
	 4. there is an if else to do a check or a swap
		 1. cwe know where the carrot is so there is no need for a check function
		 2. swap function.
			 1. ask if they want to swap first
			 2. the has player1 and player 2 dictionaries
				 1. negate the values in the key value pair for the carrot key


## Pseudocode
``` pseudocode
	
player_names = []

# PLACE HOLDER: text printed introducing the code


FUNCTION ask_pl_name():
	return commandline.input("please input your name? use only letters and numbers")

FUNCTION add_player(name):
	if name not in player_names: 
		player_names.append(name)

FUNCTION print_carrot(box1): 
	if player_names.index(name) == 1: # if the index of the of the element is 1
	if box1:
		print("You have a carrot")
	else:
		print("You don't have the carrot)
   
lie = commandline.input("Do you want to lie or say the truth? \nrespond with 'T' or 'L' ")
    
FUNCTION lie_about_carrot(lie. carrot):      
	if carrot:
		if lie == 'T':
			print("I have the carrot")
		if lie == 'L':
			print("I don't have the carrot")
	else:
		if lie == 'T':
			print("I don't have the carrot")
		if lie == 'L':
			print("I have the carrot")
			
FUNCTION second_player_route(box1, box2): # if it the second player
	swap = commandline.input("Do you want to swap the boxes? respond with 'Y' or 'N' ")
	     
	if swap == 'Y':
		 box1 = not box1
		 box2 = not box2
		
	return box1, box2 # returns a tuple
```

2. there is a box function 
	1. which can choose whether it has a carrot or not
		1. random number generation between 0 and 1
``` pseudocode
FUNCTION choose_carrot():

	carrot = random.choose([0,1]) 
	# get a ramdom number generator to choose between the numbers in a list. this is done instead of just the numbers so that decimals are not choosen
	return carrot 
```



3. there is a function that is in charge of printing stuff to the command line and
	1. the main function
``` pseudocode
player_names = []

# PLACE HOLDER: text printed introducing the code


FUNCTION ask_pl_name():
	return commandline.input("please input your name? use only letters and numbers")

FUNCTION add_player(name):
	if name not in player_names: 
		player_names.append(name)

FUNCTION print_carrot(box1, name1): 
	if box1:
		print(name1 + has the carrot)
	else:
		print(name1 + doesn't have the carrot)
   

    
FUNCTION lie_about_carrot(lie. carrot):      
	if carrot:
		if lie == 'T':
			print("I have the carrot")
		if lie == 'L':
			print("I don't have the carrot")
	else:
		if lie == 'T':
			print("I don't have the carrot")
		if lie == 'L':
			print("I have the carrot")
			
FUNCTION second_player_route(box1, box2):  # if it the second player
	swap = commandline.input("Second player do you want to swap the boxes? respond with 'Y' or 'N' ")
	     
	if swap == 'Y':
		 box1 = not box1
		 box2 = not box2
		
	return box1, box2 # returns a tuple
FUNCTION choose_carrot():

	carrot = random.choose([0,1]) 
	# get a ramdom number generator to choose between the numbers in a list. this is done instead of just the numbers so that decimals are not choosen
	return carrot 



FUNCTION main():
	print("the explanation of how to play the game")

	name1 = ask_pl_name()
	name2 = ask_pl_name()
	
	add_player(name1)
	add_player(name2)
	
	box1 = choose_carrot()
	box2 = not box1

	print_carrot(box1, player_names[0])
			
	lie = commandline.input("Do you want to lie or say the truth? \nrespond with 'T' or 'L' ")
	
	lie_about_carrot(lie, box1)
	
	box1, box2 = second_player_route(box1, box2)
	print(name1 + "having the carrot is" + box1)
	print(name2 + "having the carrot is" + box2)
		
```



### Dependencies in the system requirements
- req1 depends on 1.2, 2
- req 2 depends on none
- req 3 depends on 1, 1,2, 2
 

### Validity☑️
- done via inspection, what was i looking 4? how does the code coniside with the respetive function?
### Consistency ☑️
- done via inspectionwhat was i looking 4? how does the code coniside with the respetive function?
### Realism ☑️
- done via inspection what was i looking 4? how does the code coniside with the respetive function?
### Boundaries ☑️
- not written in a way to extend the number of players or things in the box.
