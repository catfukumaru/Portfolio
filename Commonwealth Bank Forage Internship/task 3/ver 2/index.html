        <h2>Make sure that the companies are legit</h2>
        <div class="content">
        <p>Do some research on the company. Don't assume that because the website the design is modern that it is trustworthy. This can be done by typing the name of the company with terms like “review,” “complaint,” or “scam.” If what you find out is not favourable towards the company or that there is no contact information of the company then consider if the risk is necessary.</p>

        <h2>Only share your information on websites that encrypt your information</h2>
        <div class="content">
        <p>To find out if the website is encrypted look for https at the start of the web address. Look out for https on every page of the site else your data would still be at risk.</p>

        <h2>Be careful of what you click</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>If you are not sure if the link is legit then go to the financial firm's website or use their app to check if they sent the information. If you click on it then you could be exposing yourself to malware.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Do not use public computers to access your financial accounts</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Public computers could have software that can save your passwords. If you do not have a choice then delete your "Temporary Internet Files” and clear your "History" after you log out of your account. It is also advised that you use strong passwords on your devices and financial apps.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Use encrypted and trusted Wi-Fi</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Public hotspots focus more on making their networks easy to access which comes at the expense of their security. Such hotspots can be found in in airports, hotels and restaurants. The lack of security makes your data easier to obtain. Another tactic that hackers use is that they will make public networks with familiar-sounding names to trap people.</p>
